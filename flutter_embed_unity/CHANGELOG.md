> NOTE: To take advantage of the new automated steps for iOS Unity export, you will need to re-import the latest flutter_embed_unity_2022_3.unitypackage found in [Releases](https://github.com/learntoflutter/flutter_embed_unity/releases) - you only need the changes in `FlutterEmbed/Editor/ProjectExporterIos.cs`
>
> Alternatively, you can simply modify your existing copy of `FlutterEmbed/Editor/ProjectExporterIos.cs` according to [this commit](https://github.com/learntoflutter/flutter_embed_unity/commit/c393efc0e9fbc589e2e4c1045e52d5335830895a)
